# Agent Factory Workbench

Agent Factory is a local-first workbench that turns raw requirements into reviewed planning artifacts and a review-gated ADK Runtime Handoff. Its first user is a development leader who needs to make architecture, ownership, reuse, and delivery boundaries reviewable before implementation begins.

The workbench refines a requirement through a short evidence-preserving flow:

1. **Analyze** the raw requirement, evidence, assumptions, and missing information.
2. **Design and review** asset boundaries, Workflow Graph IR, contracts, ownership, and reuse decisions.
3. **Approve** the reviewed artifacts through explicit human gates.
4. **Build and hand off** only from approved artifacts.
5. **Verify** artifact consistency and record validation evidence and Catalog proposals.

Raw requirements do not directly generate code. ADK Runtime Handoff is a reviewed source-bundle handoff for follow-up implementation or local execution checks; it is not production deployment. The `output_mode` values `smoke` and `runnable` both consume reviewed artifacts, and neither represents production business logic or deployment readiness.

## Target Contract

Agent Factory reviews three top-level asset types. Their full definitions, attributes, and decision rules belong only in the canonical [Taxonomy](docs/workbench/taxonomy.md).

- **Agent** — an executable asset with an independent reasoning and judgment responsibility.
- **Workflow** — an executable asset that owns the flow and control of multiple execution units.
- **Tool** — a callable asset with a clear input contract and a clear result or error contract.

Catalog Taxonomy and Workflow Graph IR describe different layers. The Catalog identifies independently reviewed and reusable Agent, Workflow, and Tool contracts; Graph IR describes what a particular Workflow executes, waits for, or joins. A Graph Node may reference a Catalog asset, but a node is not automatically a new asset. See the canonical [Graph IR](docs/workbench/graph-ir.md).

## Migration Status

The product uses strict Target Contract v2. Analyze/Design artifacts require `contract_version: "2.0"`, Agent/Workflow/Tool fields, Target bindings, and canonical Graph IR. Legacy-only roots, fields, split file names, Catalog buckets, and generator projection are not read or written. Reuse Hub presents exactly three asset types and Catalog storage is `catalog/agents.yaml`, `catalog/workflows.yaml`, and `catalog/tools.yaml`. The cutover result and intentionally unsupported inputs are recorded in [Taxonomy vNext Migration Status](docs/migration/taxonomy-vnext-status.md).

The [Hook-first Codex Companion](docs/workbench/cli-companion.md) MVP can observe Codex CLI or VS Code sessions through independent project/plugin Hook bootstraps, manage their AF-only aliases/default target, and attach an ordered Graph Node selection once to one exact session's next prompt. The VS Code launcher opens only the canonical local Worktree; it does not create or select a Codex session. Its migration target is external-Codex-owned canonical worktree writes, with Agent Factory projecting the worktree and writing only Interaction state. That ownership transition is not complete: the current Web Stage Runner, canonical editors, approvals, and Build/Verify triggers remain active. See [CLI Companion Migration Status](docs/migration/cli-companion-status.md).

## Documentation

- [Documentation index](docs/README.md) — progressive entrypoint for active project documentation.
- [Agent Factory Handbook](docs/handbook/README.md) — source-backed map from workbench behavior to current implementation locations.
- [Operating Model](docs/workbench/operating-model.md) — review stages, approval flow, artifact discipline, and verification expectations.
- [Hook-first Codex Companion](docs/workbench/cli-companion.md) — Target write ownership, project Hook Session Registry, and the current next-prompt Context MVP.

## Repository Scope

- `.agents/skills`: Agent Factory DLC skills for discovery, composition, Runtime Handoff generation, and verification. They write strict Target v2 artifacts.
- `packages/web`: React/Vite workbench for artifact review, Workflow Graph IR, Catalog governance, Runtime Handoff, and local verification surfaces.
- `.codex/hooks.json` and `plugins/agent-factory-companion`: independent thin Hook bootstraps for CLI·IDE. Both delegate to the workspace-owned `scripts/af-codex-hook.mjs`; Codex wire-shape adaptation is isolated in `scripts/af-codex-hook-protocol.mjs`, and the bridge deduplicates overlapping calls.
- `schemas`: Strict Target v2 JSON Schema contracts for normalized requirements, asset candidates, Graph IR, and scaffold plans.
- `catalog`: Reusable Agent, Workflow, and Tool contracts stored in `catalog/agents.yaml`, `catalog/workflows.yaml`, and `catalog/tools.yaml`.
- `templates`: Generic reviewed-artifact templates and scaffold-plan validation fixtures.
- `docs`: Canonical concepts, operating guidance, the source-backed Handbook, migration status, validation guidance, and historical records.

## Development

```bash
cd packages/web
npm install
npm run build
```

The web package build runs `tsc --noEmit && vite build`.

For repeatable manual UI testing, use the working-directory-independent
launcher. From the repository root, run:

```bash
./scripts/start-manual-web-test.sh
```

It starts the workbench on the fixed `http://127.0.0.1:5173/` address and uses
Vite's runner config loader. The launcher does not create, reset, or delete
artifact roots.

Artifact validation runs from the repository root:

```bash
node scripts/validate-artifacts.mjs
node scripts/validate-artifacts.mjs path/to/artifacts
```

## Security Boundary

This repository is a review workbench, not a banking deployment. Do not add private endpoints, credentials, real customer data, internal deployment scripts, or organization-specific runtime code. Runtime Handoff, Mock Lab data, examples, and smoke inputs must use synthetic data and remain local review surfaces.
