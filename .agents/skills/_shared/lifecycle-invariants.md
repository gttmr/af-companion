# Lifecycle Invariants

## Purpose

Keep the Agent Factory coding-agent lifecycle reviewable: discover candidates, compose an execution design, scaffold only from approved artifacts, then verify with fresh evidence.

## When to read

Read this reference at the start of every canonical work skill and after context compaction. Read it again before crossing from one lifecycle phase to the next.

## Decision criteria

Use the canonical sequence:

```text
af-discover-assets
  -> af-compose-solution
  -> af-scaffold-runtime
  -> af-verify-runtime
```

`af-workflow` may inspect state and route to a phase, but it does not create artifacts or change approvals.

Apply these invariants:

- `raw_requirement_to_code=false`.
- Discovery identifies Agent, Workflow, and Tool candidates; it does not finalize Graph topology or runtime APIs.
- Composition decides whether the result is standalone or a Workflow. Do not create a Workflow when one Agent or Tool is sufficient.
- Scaffolding consumes reviewed, approved artifacts only.
- Verification records observed results; it does not create prior-stage approval.
- Skills report gate state but never toggle `manifest.approvals.*` or stage status directly.
- Runtime Handoff is a local follow-up bundle, not production deployment.

## Required evidence

Before entering a phase, identify:

- artifact root and operating mode;
- current phase outputs and required predecessor artifacts;
- relevant approval gates;
- unresolved requirement-level and candidate-level missing information;
- runtime pattern evidence, if any;
- exact allowed write set and verification command.

## Artifact implications

- Discovery preserves evidence, assumptions, contradictions, and missing information separately.
- Composition preserves explicit approve, defer, or reject decisions and Target rationale.
- Stage Runner mode writes proposals only where `_shared/artifact-root-and-stage-runner.md` allows them; open that reference when Stage Runner behavior is in scope.
- Standalone mode writes only the named canonical files under one unambiguous artifact root.
- Proposal presence, run completion, and validation output never substitute for approval.

## Scaffold implications

- Prefer the server-owned artifact-sync and deterministic generator path when it applies.
- Do not hand-author generated behavior from the raw requirement.
- Keep generated smoke mode to TODO/runtime wiring and runnable mode to reviewed synthetic behavior.
- Preserve generator non-goals: no deploy scripts, private endpoints, credentials, customer data, organization-specific runtime code, or production business logic.

## Verification

Run the phase-specific check and preserve command, exit code, output summary, and residual uncertainty. For artifact-sensitive phases:

```bash
node scripts/validate-artifacts.mjs <artifact-root-or-proposed-dir>
```

Before handoff, inspect the write inventory and confirm no unrelated path changed.

## Stop conditions

Stop when:

- the artifact root, run ID, or phase is ambiguous;
- a predecessor artifact or required approval is absent;
- candidate-level missing information remains unresolved;
- a required runtime or A2A contract is not approved;
- the requested action would skip a phase, write outside the allowed set, or turn a raw requirement into code;
- the task requires product-code migration that is outside the authorized skill scope.
